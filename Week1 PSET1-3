'''Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, 
if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print

Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc'''

final = s[0]
temp = s[0]
for i in range(1,len(s)):
    if s[i] >= s[i-1]:
        temp = temp + s[i]
        if len(temp) > len(final):
            final = temp
    else:
        temp = s[i]
print('Longest substring in alphabetical order is: '+final)
